# Traffic Runner

An endless lane-switching runner built to learn Unity and game development workflows.

## About The Game

Traffic Runner is a 3D endless runner set in a lively city environment where traffic never stops.

**Download the game:** [Traffic Runner on itch.io](https://venom7784.itch.io/traffic-runner) – get the build and play!

Cars rush toward you as you sprint forward, and your objective is simple:

- Switch lanes.
- Avoid collisions.
- Collect coins.
- Survive as long as possible.

The game features a dynamic day and night cycle, creating a visually engaging experience as you run through the city streets.

This was my first fully completed Unity game, created primarily as a learning project to understand Unity’s systems, workflows, and game development fundamentals.
